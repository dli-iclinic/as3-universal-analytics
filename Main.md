## Minimum Requirement ##

This library require **Flash Player 11.0**  or **AIR 3.0** (both released on 04/10/2011).

It is possible to backport the library for earlier versions (FP 10.0 and AIR 2.0),<br>
you will need to provide your own implementation of<br>
<code>com.google.analytics.utils.generateUUID()</code>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Legacy</h2>

If you absolutely need support for <b>Flash Player 9.0</b><br>
you can use the library <a href='https://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/'>gaforflash</a>, which is now considered legacy (old!).<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Non Goals</h2>

There is no plan to support a JavaScript Bridge with <code>analytics.js</code>.<br>
<br>
It is out of question to port the library to ActionScript 2.0 (feel free to do it yourself).<br>
<br>
