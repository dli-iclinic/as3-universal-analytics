## Introduction ##

For few years people could use [gaforflash](https://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/)
to [track Flash content with Google Analytics](http://analytics.blogspot.fr/2008/11/want-to-track-adobe-flash-now-you-can.html),<br>
the solution is not perfect but it does work for the general use cases.<br>
<br>
Now, with <a href='http://analytics.blogspot.fr/2014/04/universal-analytics-out-of-beta-into.html'>the evolution of Google Analytics to Universal Analytics</a>,<br>
we can offer the Flash Platform a new library which can cover more specific and advanced use cases.<br>
<br>
Simply put, <b>as3-universal-analytics</b> is an ActionScript 3 implementation<br>
of the <a href='https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/'>Measurement Protocol</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
